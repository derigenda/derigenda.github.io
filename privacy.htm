<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><b>Privacy</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>This website collects and stores a
limited amount of information. This includes the page URL and title, whether a
desktop computer or a mobile phone is being used, what browser is being used, the
screen size, and some approximate geographical information (e.g. &#32;London&#32;). Google
Analytics allows far more to be collected but I use the most limited setting
available. This is done purely to improve the website. For instance, knowing
that many people are using phones with far lower resolutions than this website
was designed for, which is cutting off the bottom row of suggestions, led me to
reorder these so that the top three are always on the top row. Knowing that
virtually nobody is using the &#32;Past errors&#32; function, which I thought was one
of the most useful, made me realise that people didn&#39t understand how it works so
I&#39ve made sure it sometimes deselects words that aren&#39t previous errors as well
as selecting those that are. Knowing that nobody is using it to revise Greek
means I am looking at ways of making this function more prominent. There are
many other examples and none would have happened without this understanding. None
of the information collected can be linked to individual users. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>What is not collected:</p>
<ol></ol><li>Sharing results. When a vocab test is finished, the website allows the
user to share a result. It asks for a name and generates a URL that will display
that result. None of this information is sent to the server. A valid URL will even
be generated if the user switches off WiFi before finishing the vocab test. Only
the first part is seen and stored (up to &#32;.htm&#32;). The full URL is only visible
to people with whom the user chooses to share it. The URL is transmitted
securely.</li>
<li>Results
of vocab tests are calculated by the user&#39s device and are not collected.</li>
<li>Problem words are stored locally on the user&#39s device and are not uploaded to the
server.</li><ol></div>
